### Predicting Home Sale Prices in King County.
This project uses linear regression models to analyze the factors that influence home prices in the King County area. The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights and recommendations to stakeholders in the real estate industry.

### Business Problem
The stakeholder for this project is a real estate agency that helps homeowners buy and sell homes. The business problem is to provide advice to homeowners about how home renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes, and by what amount.

### Data
The King County House Sales dataset is used for this project, which can be found in kc_house_data.csv in the data folder in this project's GitHub repository. The description of the column names can be found in column_names.md in the same folder. As with most real-world data sets, the column names are not perfectly described, so some research or best judgement may be required.

### Data Understanding
The data is first explored to understand the distribution of each feature, as well as any missing values or outliers.

### Data Processing
Data cleaning techniques are used to handle any missing values or outliers, as well as encoding categorical features as necessary.

### Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is performed to visualize the distribution of each feature, as well as any relationships between features and the target variable.

### Modeling
Linear regression models are built to predict the sale price of a home based on its features. Both simple and multiple regression models are tested, as well as models with regularization to handle multicollinearity and overfitting.

### Interpretations and Recommendations
The coefficients of the final model are examined to identify the features that have the strongest effect on home prices. These features are used to make recommendations to stakeholders about how to increase the value of their homes.

### Conclusion
The linear regression models provide valuable insights into the factors that influence home prices in the King County area. These insights can be used to make informed business decisions and to provide valuable advice to homeowners. It is important to note that the models have limitations and may not capture all the factors that influence home prices. Additional factors should be considered when making decisions about buying or selling a home.
